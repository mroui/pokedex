## Introduction
**Pokedex** is an android mobile application which is kind of a **guide with useful informations** for **Pokemon** games players.
</br></br>
It allows to obtain a **knowledge** about huge **list of pokemons**, their *statistics*, *evolutions* and more!
</br></br>
Nowadays, **one of the most popular mobile games is Pokemon GO** for which Pokedex is **very usefull** and makes gameplay **more convenience**.
</br></br>
You can **search for your favourite Pokemon**, get to know about its *average height*, *attack power* or for which pokemon types *deals double damage*.
</br></br>
**Design** is a little **inspired by** this from *Pokemon GO* game, which is **minimalistic** and **user-friendly**.
</br></br>
For the proper operation of an application, **internet connection is required**.
</br></br>
Pokedex is made for **smartphone** with **Android 5.0+** system but **targeted version** is **Android 9.0** on which application **was tested**.

*An application uses the RESTful Pokemon API -> [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) .
